# LRU-Cache
implementing LRU cache in js

This is a simple implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache in JavaScript. The cache has a fixed capacity and removes the least recently used items when the capacity is exceeded.

## Features
- Fixed capacity
- O(1) time complexity for get and put operations
- Uses a combination of a doubly linked list and a hash map for efficient access and eviction
